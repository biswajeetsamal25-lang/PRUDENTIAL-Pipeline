# PRUDENTIAL-CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

This document explains how our **CI/CD process** works for Prudential Project.

---

## CI Pipeline (Continuous Integration)

The CI pipeline runs whenever new code is pushed or a pull request is created.

### Steps:

1. **Checkout Code** â€“ Gets the latest code from GitHub.
2. **Build Docker Image** â€“ Creates a Docker image of the application.
3. **Run Security Scan** â€“ Scans the Docker image with *Trivy* for vulnerabilities.
4. **Push Image** â€“ Pushes the image to Docker Hub Registry.
5. **Create Change Request (CR)** â€“ Sends details (commit, image, scan results, branch) to the Service Now ticketing system. The CR status is set to **PENDING**.

---

## CD Pipeline (Continuous Deployment)

The CD pipeline is triggered **automatically** when a Change Request is approved. The Service Now sends a **webhook** request to GitHub to start the deployment workflow.

### Steps:

1. **Webhook Trigger** â€“ When CR is approved, the ticketing system calls GitHubâ€™s workflow.
2. **Fetch CR Details** â€“ Pipeline fetches the image and branch info from the CR.
3. **Checkout Helm Charts** â€“ Pulls the Helm repo to prepare for deployment.
4. **Update Image in Helm Values** â€“ Updates the image repo and tag in `values.yaml`.
5. **Deploy to Kubernetes** â€“ Uses Helm to deploy or upgrade the app in the cluster.
6. **Update CR Status** â€“ Sends back status (e.g., `DEPLOYED`) to the ticketing system.
